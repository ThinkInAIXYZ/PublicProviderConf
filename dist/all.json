It introduces a dual-mode system that toggles between intuitive chat responses and structured “deep reasoning” mode using special system prompts. Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications.\n\nDeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *\"deep thinking\"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. \n\nSystem Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.\n"

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs.

Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications.\n\nDeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *\"deep thinking\"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. \n\nSystem Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.\n"

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens"
