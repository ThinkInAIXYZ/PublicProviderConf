Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens"

Its advanced ability to handle complex queries with minimal resources can translate into cost savings and performance.\n\nThe introduction of GPT-4o opens numerous possibilities for businesses in various sectors: \n\n1. **Enhanced customer service**: By integrating diverse data inputs, GPT-4o enables more dynamic and comprehensive customer support interactions.\n2. **Advanced analytics**: Leverage GPT-4o's capability to process and analyze different types of data to enhance decision-making and uncover deeper insights.\n3. **Content innovation**: Use GPT-4o's generative capabilities to create engaging and diverse content formats, catering to a broad range of consumer preferences.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [\"Hello GPT-4o\" (OpenAI announcement)](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)\n- [Introducing GPT-4o: OpenAI's new flagship multimodal model now in preview on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-gpt-4o-openais-new-flagship-multimodal-model-now-in-preview-on-azure/)\n"

The model has a context window of 128K tokens and knowledge up to October 2023. Thanks to the improved tokenizer shared with GPT-4o, handling non-English text is now even more cost effective.\n\nGPT-4o mini surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other small models on academic benchmarks across both textual intelligence and multimodal reasoning, and supports the same range of languages as GPT-4o. It also demonstrates strong performance in function calling, which can enable developers to build applications that fetch data or take actions with external systems, and improved long-context performance compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [OpenAI announcement](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/)\n"

Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications.\n\nDeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *\"deep thinking\"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. \n\nSystem Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.\n"

It offers a 32 k‑token context window, enabling rich multimodal conversations that combine lengthy documents with one or more images. Training emphasized fast inference on consumer GPUs while retaining strong captioning, visual‐question‑answering, and diagram‑analysis accuracy. As a result, Spotlight slots neatly into agent workflows where screenshots, charts or UI mock‑ups need to be interpreted on the fly. Early benchmarks show it matching or out‑scoring larger VLMs such as LLaVA‑1.6 13 B on popular VQA and POPE alignment tests. "

It applies extended reinforcement learning—both task-specific and general pairwise preference-based—to improve performance on complex multi-step tasks. Compared to the base GLM-4-32B model, Z1 significantly boosts capabilities in structured reasoning and formal domains.\n\nThe model supports enforced “thinking” steps via prompt engineering and offers improved coherence for long-form outputs. It’s optimized for use in agentic workflows, and includes support for long context (via YaRN), JSON tool calling, and fine-grained sampling configuration for stable inference. Ideal for use cases requiring deliberate, multi-step reasoning or formal derivations."

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens"

These models were trained with Phi-3 datasets that include both synthetic data and the filtered, publicly available websites data, with a focus on high quality and reasoning-dense properties. Phi-3.5 Mini uses 3.8B parameters, and is a dense decoder-only transformer model using the same tokenizer as [Phi-3 Mini](/models/microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct).\n\nThe models underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures. When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters."
